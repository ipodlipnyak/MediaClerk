These shell scripts are used for a smoother development process.

Signal Console
* Easily attach to a process and send signals
* Save PID file locations in an array at the top of the file and the console will read the PID from the file automatically.

SHM Console
* Easily attach to a shared memory block
* Scan the block for active keys and easily inspect the contents

Clean IPC
* Easily remove errant Semaphores, Shared Memory blocks and Inter-Process messages
* Often during development, crashed or killed daemons will leave these resources behind that have to be manually cleaned

Everything Else
* Scripts that we've used to easily start a daemon with various commandline options
* Scripts to View and Kill daemon processes
